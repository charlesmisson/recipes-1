## What are all these yaml files?

I am starting to write my recipes as `yaml` files, and then convert them to `plist` format when I'm done. I find constructing the recipes much nicer in `yaml` format. You can safely ignore the `yaml` files if you wish.

If you wish to do the same, take a look at https://github.com/grahampugh/plist-yaml-plist
